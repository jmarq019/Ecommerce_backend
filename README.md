# <Ecommerce_backend>
## Description
The point of this project was to practice using sequilize to work with an abstracted MySQL database using models rather than creating the tables using MySQL language.
# Instalation
The application can be found through this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jmarq019/Ecommerce_backend) as well as this [Heroku link](https://jorge-ecommerce-backend.herokuapp.com/). 
# Usage
The user can use the routes through an API client to add, delete, get, and get by ID, the elements from the Category, Tag, and Product models. 
# Credits
Credits go to the UW Coding Boot Camp Instructor and TA's for providing the knowledge necessary to build this application.
# Tests
The application was tested using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), the Open Source API client to test the routes.
